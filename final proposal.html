            <h1>Final Proposal!</h1>
            <h2>Project Concept/Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                I want to make a lighted bed phone holder that can be <br>
                remotely controlled so that I can use my phone and read under light in bed.
            </p>
            <h2>Anticipated Bill of Materials</h2>
            <p>
                LED Strips <br>
                Joystick<br>
                9V battery power supply<br>
                Transistor<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Timeline and contingency plans</h2>
            <p>
                March 1 - Code and test<br>
                March 3 - Install the LED strip on the holder<br>
                March 5 - Documentation<br>
                March 7 - Prepare for presentation<br>
                I have left some days for emergencies/adjustments.<br>
                If the first two steps go wrong, I would probably make the LED strip for other usages<br>
